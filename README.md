# Mose's Typst Templates

This repository contains a collection of [Typst](https://typst.app) templates.
These templates are primarily built for my personal use. That does not mean, that
they cannot be useful to you. However all design decisions are made based on my
opinion. You can try to influence that opinion by submitting an issue through the
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/moseschmiedel/mose-typst-templates/issues), but
if your proposal does not fit my view of how something should look, be implemented, etc.
I will not include it. If you want to make changes based on your own opinions, feel free
to [fork](https://github.com/moseschmiedel/mose-typst-templates/fork) this repository!
